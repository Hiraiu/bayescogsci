This book is a relatively gentle introduction to carrying out Bayesian data analysis and cognitive modeling using the probabilistic programming language Stan [@carpenter2017stan], and the front-end to Stan called `brms` [@R-brms]. Our target audience is cognitive scientists (e.g., linguists and psychologists) who carry out behavioral experiments, and who are interested in learning the Bayesian data analysis methodology from the ground up and in a principled manner. Our aim is to make Bayesian statistics a standard part of the data analysis toolkit for experimental linguistics, psycholinguistics, psychology, and related disciplines. 

Many excellent introductory textbooks exist already for Bayesian data analysis. Why write yet another book? Our text is different from other attempts in two respects. First, our main focus is on showing how to analyze data from planned experiments involving repeated measures; this type of experimental data involves unique complexities. We provide many examples of data-sets involving eyetracking (visual world and reading), self-paced reading, event-related potentials, reaction time, acceptability rating judgements, speeded grammaticality judgements, and question-response accuracies.  Second, from the very outset, we stress a particular workflow that has as its centerpiece simulating data; we aim to teach a philosophy that involves thinking hard about the assumed underlying generative process, **even before the data are collected**. The data analysis approach that we hope to teach through this book involves a cycle of prior predictive and posterior predictive checks, and model validation using simulated data. We try to inculcate a sense of how inferences can be drawn from the posterior distribution of theoretically interesting parameters without resorting to binary decisions like “significant” or “not-significant”. We are hopeful that this will set a new standard for reporting results of data analyses in a more nuanced manner, and lead to more measured claims in the published literature.    

## Prerequisites 

Any rigorous introduction to Bayesian data analysis requires at least a passive knowledge of probability theory, calculus, and linear algebra. We do not require that the reader already has this background when they start the book. Instead, the relevant ideas are introduced informally and just in time, as soon as they are needed. The reader is never required to have an active ability to solve probability problems, to solve integrals or compute derivatives, or to carry out matrix computations by hand. What we do expect is some relatively simple high school arithmetic and algebra; a quick look through chapter 1 of @gill2006essential before starting this book is highly recommended. We also expect that the reader is willing to learn enough of the programming language R [@R-base] and Stan/brms to reproduce the examples presented. 
For newcomers to R, we provide a quick introduction in the appendix that covers all the constructs used in the book.
There are many good online resources on R that the reader can consult. Examples are: [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), and [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/).


We also assume that the reader is familiar with basic frequentist data analysis methodology; in particular, the reader should know how to carry out one and two sample t-tests, both paired and unpaired, and linear mixed models [@lme4new,baayen2008mixed]. The reader should know how to interpret the t-score and p-value that are computed from such tests. Reading textbooks like @vasishthbroe2ed and @winter2019statistics before tackling the present textbook will be very helpful for the relative newcomer to statistical data analysis.
We remind the reader of some of these basic ideas in chapter 1, but we don't spend any time comparing frequentist and Bayesian methods.  We do not try to convince the reader to use the Bayesian approach over the frequentist one; our goal is to focus on the *what* and the *how* of Bayesian data analysis, and not the *why*. Other books and articles discuss the latter aspect in detail; for example, @kruschke2014doing compares frequentist and  Bayesian methods in detail.

## How to read this book

The chapters in this book are intended to be read in sequence, but during the first pass through the book, the reader should feel free to completely skip the sections marked with an asterisk. These sections provide a more formal development that will be useful when the reader transitions to more advanced textbooks like @Gelman14.  

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
to-do: add a Mackay type chapter ordering for different scenarios.
```


## Online materials

The entire book, including all data and source code, is available online for free on [https://github.com/vasishth/bayescogsci](https://github.com/vasishth/bayescogsci). The solutions to exercises are provided there under the directory solutions (to-do).

## Software needed

```{r packages, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
index <- readLines("index.Rmd")
start <- which(stringr::str_detect(index, "```\\{r load")) + 1
endings <- which(stringr::str_detect(index, "```$")) -1
end <- min(endings[endings>start])

to_install <- index[start:end] %>%
    stringr::str_match("library\\((.*)\\)") %>%
    {.[,2]} %>%
    .[complete.cases(.)] %>%
    .[. != "rstan"]

installation <- paste0("install.packages(c(", list_code(to_install),")")

```

Before you start, please install

  - [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), or any other Integrated Development Environment that you prefer)
  - The R package `rstan` (please pay close attention to the installation instructions!):
    - [Instructions for Windows](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-on-Windows)
    - [Instructions for Mac or Linux](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-on-Mac-or-Linux) 
  - The R packages  `r list_str(to_install)`, can be installed the usual way: ` `r installation ` `
  
In every R session, we'll need to set a seed (this ensures that the random numbers are always the same when we re-run our code). 

```{r load, cache = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(42)
library(MASS)
##be careful to load dplyr after MASS
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(readr)
library(extraDistr)
library(ggplot2)
library(brms)
library(rstan)
## Save compiled models:
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
## Parallelize the chains using all the cores:
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
library(bayesplot)
library(tictoc)
library(gridExtra)


# To solve some conflicts between  packages
select <- dplyr::select
extract <- rstan::extract
```

```{r, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
## Defauls values of some parameters
# I don't want windows opening:
formals(stan)$open_progress <- FALSE
# To be able to include full citations:
## library(RefManageR)
## bibl <- ReadBib("BayesCogSci.bib",check = "warn")
## citetitle <- function(key){
##     bibl[key= key]$title
## }
## fullcite <-  function(key){
##         capture.output(print(bibl[key= key]))
## }
library(bibtex)
bibl <- read.bib("BayesCogSci.bib")
fullcite <-  function(key){
    capture.output(print(bibl[key]))
}

## Look and feel:
# Plots
bayesplot_theme_set(theme_light())
theme_set(theme_light())
# format
options(
    htmltools.dir.version = FALSE,
    formatR.indent = 2,
    width = 55,
    digits = 2,
    signif =2,
    warnPartialMatchAttr = FALSE,
    warnPartialMatchDollar = FALSE,

    # tibbles:
    tibble.width = Inf,
    tibble.print_max = 5,
    tibble.print_min = 5
)
